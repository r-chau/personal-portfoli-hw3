## Final Homework Part 3 - Other Enhancements
I go rid of all the placeholder images and descriptions that I had on my main and about me page. I also got rid of a lot of redundancies I had since the pages seemed too similar, so I decided to keep skills/coding on one and more playful on the about me. I switched up my HTML to have links open a new tab so that potential website visitors don't accidentally leave my page. Finally I brushed up the CSS to match my initial plan for my portfolio website layout.
